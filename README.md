## PCSC - Project 5: Non-linear systems

### Project description:
_Implementation of numerical methods for the solution of nonlinear
equations._  
* Mandatory: consider a scalar nonlinear problem and implement the
bisection, aitken, chord, newton and fixed point methods.
* Optional: extension to systems of nonlinear equations solved by the
Newton and/or modified Newton method.
* Sources: here for the Newtonâ€™s, chord and bisection method, and here for
the fixed point method. Here for the Aitken acceleration to be applied to
these methods.
