## PCSC - Project 5: Non-linear systems

### Project description:
_Implementation of numerical methods for the solution of nonlinear
equations._  
* Mandatory: consider a scalar nonlinear problem and implement the bisection, aitken, chord, newton and fixed point methods.
* Optional: extension to systems of nonlinear equations solved by the Newton and/or modified Newton method.
* Sources: [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118673515.app8) for the Newtonâ€™s, chord and bisection method, and [here](https://mat.iitm.ac.in/home/sryedida/public_html/caimna/transcendental/iteration%20methods/fixed-point/iteration.html) for the fixed point method. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process) for the Aitken acceleration to be applied to these methods.
