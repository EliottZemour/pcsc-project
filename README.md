GROUP 7.   
_Implementation of numerical methods for the solution of nonlinear equations (NLE)._  

The numerical methods implemented are:
* Bisection,
* Fixed point methods:
  * Chord,
  * Newton

And an acceleration feature through Aitken's delta squared process is also implemented according to this [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process).  
The main source for this project can be found at [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118673515.app8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118673515.app8).

Finally, this project includes an extension to systems of nonlinear equations (NLS) solved by the Newton method in n-dimensions.
